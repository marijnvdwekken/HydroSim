# OpenPLC in the Simulation Environment

This project integrates OpenPLC for simulating programmable logic controllers (PLCs) within the virtual environment. It leverages the repository [OpenPLC-Docker-AutoStart](https://github.com/koztkozt/OpenPLC-Docker-AutoStart) to automate the import and configuration of PLCs using pre-defined `.ST` files during the build process.

## Purpose and Functionality

The OpenPLC setup allows for the inclusion of multiple PLCs to control various zones within the simulation environment. Each PLC can be configured with a specific `.ST` (Structured Text) file, representing the logic for that zone. This provides flexibility in designing complex scenarios involving different operational zones.

## Adding a PLC

To add a new PLC to the environment, you can modify the `docker-compose.yaml` file. Use the following syntax as a template:

```yaml
plc-zone*:
  container_name: plc-zone* # Replace * with the zone name (e.g., plc-zone1, plc-zone2)
  depends_on:
    - scadalts
  build:
    context: ./openplc/.
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    args:
      script: watertanklogica.st # Replace with the .ST file the PLC should execute
      database: database.sh # Database script; do not modify
  ports:
    - "8082:8080" # Port mapping for external access and debugging; can be disabled if not required
  expose:
    - "502" # Modbus/TCP communication port
    - "8080" # WebUI access; can be removed if not needed
  networks:
    - plc_network
```

# Ladder Logic for ScadaLTS Integration

This repository contains the ladder logic program designed to interact with ScadaLTS via holding registers. The program controls a pump's speed and interacts with EPANET for simulation purposes.

Download to the openplc editor to make the ladderlogic:
- [Openplc-editor](https://autonomylogic.com/download/).

## Overview
The ladder logic program uses holding registers to communicate with ScadaLTS. Pump speeds are exposed as IEEE‑754 `REAL` values that occupy two consecutive Modbus holding registers starting at address `1000`. The high word (`%QW1000`) contains the most significant bits and the low word (`%QW1001`) contains the least significant bits so that EPANET can read the values directly as `FLOAT32`.

## Variables
Below are the primary variables used in the ladder logic:

- **PumpSpeed**: Exported as a 32-bit float split over `%QW1000`/`%QW1001` (and subsequent even/odd pairs for additional pumps).
- **StartButton**: A functional button within ScadaLTS. Can be assigned between `%QX0.0 – %QX99.7`.  
- **Reference**: For additional details on Modbus addressing, visit [OpenPLC-Adressing](https://autonomylogic.com/docs/2-5-modbus-addressing/).

## Components
-  Contacts: Represent inputs such as StartButton.
-  Coils: Control outputs like pump activation.
-  Blocks: Handle logic operations and data manipulation.

## Logic Explanation
The ladder logic program performs the following tasks:
1. Reads the start button from ScadaLTS.
2. Writes the pump speed to `%QW1000` for EPANET simulation.
3. This turns the pump on and makes the water flow through.

## Upload ST file to openplc program
1.  Export the Ladder logic.
-  Save it as an NameOfProgram.ST.
